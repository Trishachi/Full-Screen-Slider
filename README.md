# Full-Screen-Slider

This is a full-page slider built on CSS3 using transitions and transforms.

The slider requires human interaction (clicking on the slide button on the top navigation) to change the sliders.
It can be made more dynamic (change automatically) by adding some jQuery script/functionality to it.
